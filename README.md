# Questionable Advice Generator

This is a simple web application that displays questionable advice. Click the button to get a piece of "advice".

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click the "Get Some 'Advice'" button.
3. Read the questionable advice.
4. Repeat.

## How it works

The application fetches advice from a `advice.json` file and displays it randomly. The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
