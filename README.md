# Cheesy Advice Generator

This is a simple web application that displays cheesy advice. Click the button to get a piece of advice that's been "cheese-ified" with puns, or even a straight-up cheese joke.

## How to use

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Click the "Get Some Gouda Advice" button.
3.  Read the cheesy advice.
4.  Repeat for more cheesy goodness.

## How it works

The application fetches advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/). The fetched advice is then processed by a `cheeseify` function that replaces common words with cheese-related puns. There is also a 10% chance that you will get a pure cheese joke instead of advice.

The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
